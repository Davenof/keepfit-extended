# keepfitextended
<p>
This is the partially dynamic version of the KeepFit project. The original project was a hand-coded static prototype which was designed to be the web version of a mobile fitness app which allows teachers and instructors track the activity of students using wrist-worn devices.

<p>
This version is partially dynamic because only a few aspects of the "Class Login" side of the prototype is dynamic. Other aspects of the "Class Login", as well as the entire "Remote Login" side are static.

<strong>PHP</strong>
<p>
PHP was used to develop the "Signup" and "Login" systems, and to connect the systems to the users databases created with MySQL. PHP was used also to call the primary and secondary "navigation bars", the "sidebar", and the footer into all pages. Furthermore, PHP was used to dynamically display the email address, name, and designation (teacher or instructor) of the logged-in user, and to notify users to log in when they try to access a page that only logged in users have access to.
</p>

<strong>MySQL</strong>
<p>
MySQL was used to create the the relational database that stores users' data.
